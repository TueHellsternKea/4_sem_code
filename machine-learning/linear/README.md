# Consumer Behavior
**Using AI and Machine Learning to Predict Consumer Behavior**

Companies understand that predicting customer behavior fills the gap in the markets and identifies products that are needed and which could generate bigger revenue.

# Example Stress
Stress detection with machine learning from text strings. The dataset for this task contains data posted on subreddit's related to mental health. 

This dataset contains various mental health problems shared by people about their life. This dataset is labelled as 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no stress and 1 indicates stress.

The data is: [stress_csv.csv](./code/stress_csv.csv)

I have used Jupyter Lab for this - [DetectStress.ipynb](./code/DetectStress.ipynb)

# Example Twitter
Use the Bernoulli algorithm for detection of the language on Twitter.

Data is in [twitter.csv](../07-Machine_Learning_2/code/twitter.csv)
