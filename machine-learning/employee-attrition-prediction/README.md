Employee attrition refers to an employees voluntary or involuntary departure from an organization. The cost of employee attrition can be huge since replacing human resources with desired skill sets in a limited time is a difficult and costly task.

Knowing in advance the likelihood that employees are going to leave an organization can help organizations make an effort to boost employee retention and proactively hire replacements in time.
Machine learning systems have been developed to flag potential employee attrition, as weâ€™ll demonstrate in this tutorial.
This tutorial will walk you through how to develop a machine learning employee attrition prediction model with the Python [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
